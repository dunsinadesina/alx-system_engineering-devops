Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on May 5th, 2024
Impact: The outage affected approximately 30% of users, resulting in slow loading times and intermittent errors while accessing the subscription management feature of our streaming service.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the database replication setup, leading to degraded performance and occasional service interruptions.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates for the subscription management service
10:15 AM:  Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting network congestion or database overload.
10:45 AM: Misleadingly, attention was focused on potential code changes that might have impacted database queries.
11:15 AM: With no improvement after rollback of recent code changes, the incident was escalated to the database administration team.
11:30 AM: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the database replication process.
12:00 PM: Corrective actions were taken to reconfigure the database replication setup to its intended state.
12:30 PM: Service was restored to normal operation, and users reported improved performance and functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was traced to an incorrect setting in the database replication configuration, causing replication lag and impacting the performance of the subscription management service. The issue was resolved by configuring the database replication setup to ensure proper synchronization between primary and replica databases. Additionally, database performance metrics were optimized to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Corrective and Preventive Measures:
Improvement/Fixes: Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect database replication issues more effectively, conduct regular audits of database configurations to prevent misconfigurations, and implement automated testing of database failover procedures.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch the database replication configuration to align with best practices
Implement additional monitoring checks to alert on replication lag and configuration discrepancies
Conduct a thorough review of all database configurations to identify and rectify any inconsistencies.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineers on database management and troubleshooting techniques.
By implementing these corrective and preventive measures, we aim to strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure and minimize the risk of similar outages in the future, ensuring a seamless experience for our users.
